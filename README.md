After 27 days. I am commiting a code from a video I saw on youtube. I first started coding it with what I previously learned.
I coded functions to determine the computer and player selection. But when I tried to use everything with the for loop I 
could not get past the logical errors. 
I am going foward and learn arrays and queryselectors. That are mostly used in the code I commited.
